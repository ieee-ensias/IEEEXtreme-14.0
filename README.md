[IEEEXtreme](https://ieeextreme.org/) is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. In this __repository__, you will find __Problems__ and __Solutions__ submitted by  from IEEE ENSIAS Student Branch team : __TLE__  _(ranked First in Morocco and 233/3701 Worldwide)_ composed by [Abdellatif AIT HAMMADI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaiit/) and [M'hamed SEFIANE-EL OUADGHIRI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-hamed-sefiane-el-ouadghiri-547736198/).
